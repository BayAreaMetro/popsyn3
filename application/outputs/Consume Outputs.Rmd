## Administration

#### Purpose
Consumes outputs from the Population Synthesizer. These procedures replace previous procedures done in SQL. A PUMS data dictionary is available [here](http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/pums/data_dict/PUMSDataDict13.pdf).   

#### Outputs
1.  Database to be used with Tableau (see `validation/Validation Test.twb` saved as `Year 20XX Validation Test YY.twb`)

#### TODO
1. Add non-control validation variables
2. Non-control check brainstorm: age distribution (county), student status (region), part-time workers (county), race\ethnicity (county), sex (region)

## Procedure

#### Overhead
```{r overhead, results = 'hide'}
library(knitr)
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(stringr)
suppressMessages(library(RMySQL))
suppressMessages(library(hydroGOF))
library(reshape2)
```

```{r config, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

#### Paramaters
```{r parameters}
MYSQL_SERVER    = "localhost"
MYSQL_DATABASE  = "pop_syn"
MYSQL_USER_NAME = "root" 

# simulation year
YEAR = "year_2000"
# YEAR = "year_2005"
# YEAR = "year_2010"

# year of pums source
PUMS_YEAR = "2007_2011"

HH_INCOME_QUARTILE_THRESH_1 = 30000
HH_INCOME_QUARTILE_THRESH_2 = 60000
HH_INCOME_QUARTILE_THRESH_3 = 100000
```

#### Remote file locations
```{r remote-dir}
MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE <- "C:/Users/dory/Desktop/mysql.csv"
F_OUTPUT <- paste("~/GitHub/popsyn3/application/validation/", YEAR, "_test_00.csv", sep = "")
```

#### Data reads
```{r data-reads}
# get password
mysql_passes <- read.csv(MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE, header = TRUE)

mysql_passes <- mysql_passes %>%
  filter(user == MYSQL_USER_NAME) %>%
  mutate(pwd = paste(pwd))

# connection
mysql_connection <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user = MYSQL_USER_NAME, password = mysql_passes$pwd, host = MYSQL_SERVER, dbname = MYSQL_DATABASE)

# read the synthetic population tables
household_df <- dbReadTable(conn = mysql_connection, name = paste('synpop_hh', YEAR, sep = '_'))
person_df <- dbReadTable(conn = mysql_connection, name = paste('synpop_person', YEAR, sep = '_'))

# read in the controls for validation
maz_controls <-    dbReadTable(conn = mysql_connection, name = paste('control_totals_maz', YEAR, sep = '_'))
taz_controls <-    dbReadTable(conn = mysql_connection, name = paste('control_totals_taz', YEAR, sep = '_'))
county_controls <- dbReadTable(conn = mysql_connection, name = paste('control_totals_meta', YEAR, sep = '_'))

# read in the relevant PUMS data to build cross-validation summaries
pums_household <- dbReadTable(conn = mysql_connection, name = paste('household_table', PUMS_YEAR, sep = '_'))
pums_person    <- dbReadTable(conn = mysql_connection, name = paste('person_table', PUMS_YEAR, sep = '_'))

dbDisconnect(mysql_connection)

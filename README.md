# Population Synthesizer

MTC's Travel Model Two modeling system (currently under development) will use this population synthesizer.  For details on Travel Model Two, please see the [project webpage](http://bayareametro.github.io/travel-model-two/) and the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/travel-model-two). 

The source code for the Population Synthesizer was provided by the [Maricopa County Association of Governments](http://www.azmag.gov/). We are grateful for their investment in the software and their permission to use the software. MAG asks us to note:

# Repository File Structure

* application - older files.  Will be cleaned/deprecated.
* build - Built java classes, created when `go_go_build.bat` is run.
* census_data - Census and PUMS data.  Not in github since these include huge files; these are copied from Box in `runPopSynIII.bat`
* outputs - final output, including intermediate files and validation plots and summaries
* release - Built java Archive files, created when `go_go_build.bat` is run.
* runtime - final compiled executables and configuration
* scripts - batch and R scripts used to run the entire PopSyn process
* src - Not in github.  Put source java files here for building.

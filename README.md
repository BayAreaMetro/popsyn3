Population Synthesizer

MTC's Travel Model Two modeling system (currently under development) will use this population synthesizer.  For details on Travel Model Two, please see the [project webpage](http://data.mtc.ca.gov/travel-model-two/) and the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/travel-model-two).
